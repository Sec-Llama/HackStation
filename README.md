## **Installation**

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before using the script, ensure your system is a **Debian-based OS** (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu, etc.) with root or sudo access.

### **2. Installing HackStation Toolkit**

Clone the repository and run the installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sec-Llama/HackStation.git
cd HackStation
sudo bash install_tools.sh
```

This script will automatically install the tools listed in the toolkit. You can choose to install individual tools, groups of tools, or all tools at once.

---

## **Usage**

Once the script completes, you can run HackStation with the following options:

```bash
sudo bash install_tools.sh
```

* **1) Install a specific tool**: Select a tool from the list and install it individually.
* **2) Install a group of tools**: Install a predefined group of tools (e.g., Recon\_OSINT, Web\_Hacking).
* **3) Install all the tools**: Install all tools from all groups.
* **4) ToolCheck**: Check the installation status of each tool. This will display the installed tools in a visual format.
* **5) Exit**: Exit the menu.

## **Example:**

### **Install a Specific Tool**

If you want to install just **Amass**, you can choose option 1 and select it from the list.

```bash
1) Install a specific tool
2) Install a group of tools
3) Install all the tools
4) ToolCheck
5) Exit
```

Then, simply follow the prompts to install.

## **Tool Installation Methods**

The tools are installed using **official installation methods** to ensure reliability:

* **APT**: Tools available in the systemâ€™s repository (e.g., `sudo apt install nmap`)
* **Snap**: For tools like Amass (e.g., `sudo snap install amass`)
* **Go**: Tools like Amass and httpx are installed via Go (e.g., `go install github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master`)
* **Ruby Gem**: Tools like WPScan and Bettercap use the Ruby gem package manager (e.g., `gem install wpscan`)
* **GitHub**: Some tools are installed by cloning their GitHub repositories (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester.git`)

---

## **Troubleshooting**

* If you encounter any errors related to dependencies, ensure your system is fully updated by running:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

* For any installation issues, check the official installation documentation for the specific tool.
